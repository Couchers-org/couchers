                  <p>Couch-surfing story: Zemo Alvani, Georgia. A man invites me for dinner while I wait for my host. I have to navigate drinking enough homemade wine to not be rude and not drinking too much for when I meet my host. Didn't go well but after a sleep-in we still managed to drive up a very dangerous road for hours to hang out with my host's cowboy buddies in the mountains. <a href="https://github.com/itsiw">@itsiw</a> on GitHub.</p>
