### What is couch surfing?

Couch surfing is a non-transactional hospitality that is focused on meaningful interactions between the guest and the host rather than the accommodations and amenities.

When you are a couch surfer, you are either hosting someone for free, or staying with someone for free, or meeting up with a local to hang out together. Before agreeing to meet, the host and guest communicate plans and availability during the visit so it is clear what to expect. Couch surfing is NOT for dating, looking for romance or sex, or for physical encounters. It is for making new friends from all around the world, sharing experiences and learning from one another.


### Is it okay to look for a date, romance, or sex on Couchers.org?

No. It is forbidden to use Couchers.org for the purpose of flirting, dating, seeking out romantic or sexual partners, or for engaging in sexual activities. Violation of this rule is grounds for an immediate and permanent ban.


### Can I message anyone I want?

Currently you can only message someone if you are friends with them or if there is an open request between you and them. In the future we plan to enable messaging between all users, even if you are not friends.


### Can I add anyone as a friend?

You should only add someone as a friend if you know them in real life -- either from interacting with each other in person or online at a virtual event. Do not add someone as a friend if you have not interacted with them in person or at a virtual event.
