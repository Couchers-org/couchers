<a class="handbook-anchor" name="whatis"></a>
### What is couch surfing?

Couch surfing is non-transactional hospitality that is focused on meaningful interactions between the guest and the host rather than the accommodations and amenities.

When you are a couch surfer, you are either hosting someone for free, or staying with someone for free, or meeting up with a local to hang out together. Before agreeing to meet, the host and guest communicate plans and availability during the visit so it is clear what to expect. Couch surfing is NOT for dating, looking for romance or sex, or for physical encounters. It is for making new friends from all around the world, sharing experiences and learning from one another.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="dating"></a>
### Is it okay to look for a date, romance, or sex on Couchers.org?

No. It is forbidden to use Couchers.org for the purpose of flirting, dating, seeking out romantic or sexual partners, or for engaging in sexual activities. Violation of this rule is grounds for an immediate and permanent ban.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="messaging"></a>
### Can I message anyone I want?

Currently you can only message someone if you are friends with them or if there is an open request between you and them. In the near future we plan to enable messaging between all users, even if you are not friends. This limitation was originally intended to prevent unsolicited messages from random people and to stop spam.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="friending"></a>
### Can I add anyone as a friend?

You should only add someone as a friend if you know them in real life -- either from interacting with each other in person or online at a virtual event. Do not add someone as a friend if you have not interacted with them in person or at a virtual event.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="hosting"></a>
### Do I have to host someone? Is it required that I be a host sometime?

No. You do not have to host someone, and you do not have to set your hosting status to "can host" or "maybe can host". You are also not required to meet up with anyone. However, it is recommended that you consider opening up your home to hosting or setting your status as willing to meet up as soon as you are comfortable and your life situation allows.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="askmoney"></a>
### Can I ask for money, gifts, donations, services or work when interacting with other people on Couchers.org?

No. Keep things non-transactional. Don't exchange money, goods, work, donations, or services while staying, hosting, or meeting up. Couchers.org is about learning, experiences, and getting to know people.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="eventpayment"></a>
### Can I create an event that requires payment?

It is forbidden to create, host, share, or promote an event that solicits donations, tips, required payments, or is for-profit.
* It is okay to ask for "gas money" or transportation costs if the event involves necessary transportation that is associated with a significant cost. However, neither the Couchers event organizer nor any associates of the organizer may profit from the transportation costs directly or indirectly.
* It is okay to make event attendees aware of a "cover charge" or "entrance fee" associated with a public venue where the event is held. However, neither the Couchers event organizer nor any associates of the organizer may profit from the cover charge directly or indirectly.
* It is ok to ask attendees to cover their own food and drink costs at an event, as long as neither the Couchers event organizer nor any associates of the organizer may profit from these costs.
* It is okay to ask attendees to bring food or drinks to an event (for example: at a "potluck").


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="spam"></a>
### Is it okay to advertise or promote my business, organization, or cause on Couchers.org?

No. It is a violation of the Terms of Service to use the platform to advertise, promote, or advocate for a business, organization or cause. With that said, it is okay to mention your approval/disapproval of, interest in, or involvement with a business, organization, or cause, as long as that is not the primary purpose of your profile or message.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="report"></a>
### How do I report someone or something that violates the Community Guidelines or Terms of Use (ToU)?

#### Option 1
1. Visit the person’s profile.
2. Click on the flag symbol (located below their profile photo or gray circle if they have no photo).
3. Select the reason from the dropdown menu.
4. Fill out the form with further details (OPTIONAL)
5. Click "Submit".

#### Option 2
Send an email to [safety@couchers.org](mailto:safety@couchers.org). If you send an email, be sure to include the following information:
1. Your username.
2. The person’s username you are reporting (or a link to their profile).
3. Provide as many details about what happened as possible.

**Note:** If you're not sure if something is a violation or not, it is better to just report it. The support team will review the report before any action is taken.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="reachsupport"></a>
### How do I reach support if I have a question?

* Email [support@couchers.org](mailto:support@couchers.org)
* Alternatively, you can visit the forum at [community.couchers.org](https://community.couchers.org) to see if someone has asked that question before and you may find your answer there.


<a class="handbook-anchor" name="decide"></a>
### What are some things I should think about before responding to a request?

You should read the person's entire profile and read through their references. References can give you an idea of what others think about the person. It is also very important to communicate thoroughly with the person before accepting their request. Be sure to ask any for any information that is missing from their profile or request message. For example, if their profile is empty or missing a photo, it is okay to ask them to fill out their profile and/or upload a photo before accepting their request. 

It is also good to ask them when they will arrive and when they will leave, why they are coming, and who is coming with them. It is helpful to let them know what your schedule looks like and how available you will be to interact with them. You should also let them know about any important information about you, your home, and your schedule that is relevant to their visit.

Keep communication on the Couchers.org platform as much as possible. Use common sense when providing personal information like your address and schedule. Keep in mind that you are never obligated to accept a request or provide a reason for why you cannot accept. If you decline a request, the person will not be able to message you again unless you add them as a friend. If you accept a request but change your mind, you can reject a request up until the start date of the request by clicking the "reject" button at the bottom of the request.
