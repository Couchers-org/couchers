We publish regular development updates to let you know what we have been working on, as well as what's coming soon.

## Roadmap

A quick overview of what the development team will be working on in the next few weeks.

### Events and community building

We've continued adding more features to the events in this release and will hopefully finish them up in the next release.

We're actively looking for Community Builders who wannt to help grow the community on Couchers.org. Please let us know by filling in the [Community Builder form](https://couchers.org/community-builder-form) if you're interested!

### Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We're still looking for developers who could help us build our React Native-based mobile app. Please let us know if you can help by completing the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute).

## Latest features and bugfixes

Here's a couple of the features we worked on in the last two weeks:

* Donations: added a [donation page](https://app.couchers.org/donate), so you can contribute financially if you'd like to support the project [[#1553](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/pull/1553)]
* Profile: updated the language lists to add more languages and dialects [[#1699](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/pull/1699), [#1821](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/pull/1821)]
* Events: implemented event discussions as well as joining and leaving events [[#1756](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/pull/1756)]
* Friend requests: added an email notification for when your friend request is accepted [[#1438](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/pull/1438)]

* Policy: added a cookie banner and added section in Terms of Service on cookies [[#1808](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/pull/1808)]

## Stats

Since the last update, 12 developers contributed to Couchers.org through 130 changes that changed 3.3 thousand lines of code. We welcome the two new contributors who joined in the project and helped out on the codebase.

None of this would be possible without our 100+ volunteers working in all areas of the project. The development teams would like to thank the rest of the core contributors for making our work possible.

## Join the development team

You can join our development team on GitHub at [Couchers-org/couchers](https://github.com/couchers-org/couchers); or if you don't have time right now, give us a star to show your support! We work in the open and need as much help as we can get to build teh next generation couch surfing platform!
