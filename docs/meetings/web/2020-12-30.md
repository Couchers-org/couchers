# Frontend meeting 30 Dec 2020

### Present: Aapeli, Lucas

## Discussion

- All present agree that front-end frameworks are over-complicated

- Moving forward all front-end work is to use jQuery and direct DOM manipulation

- It's 2020, after all

## Actual discussion

- Everything is progressing well

- Aapeli talked about what he is working on (GIS features)

- We could use more devs (backend and frontend). If you are reading this, recruit your mates :D
