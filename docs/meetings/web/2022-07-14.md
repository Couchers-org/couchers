# Frontend meeting 14 July 2022

**Present:** Darren, Guillermo, Jessie, Lucas

## Discussion

- Frontend refactor for new backend
  - Difficult to find time for such a large refactor for current volunteers
  - Also considering the backend is not complete, dev feedback loop is very slow (fields missing, tell backend team, wait for changes, etc.)

- Still many suitable issues to work on such as Profile/other redesigns, bugfixes, translation keys, etc.

- Darren will review profile translation key PR

- Translation keys are 90% complete, just a few stragglers left
