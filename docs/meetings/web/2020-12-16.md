# Frontend Meeting

## 16 Dec 2020

**Present:** Aapeli, Darren, Sherri, Lucas

## Notes

- Marco is now focusing on backend

- State management? Nearly all state is server-side, so react-query or swr probably more suitable

- React-query has 1k more stars, swr is more used for next.js

- Auth state? Context is enough for now, maybe mobx later if needed

- Actions in seperate context

- Add hook tests https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/testing

- Need logic to query username, not just id

- Change users cache to react-query, slightly longer stale time?

- CMS for app text? - contentful is one. Possibly just use a 'resource file'

- Some way to change strings in the app without code, translations - transifex?

- Release the product first and this is something to add in the future.

- Sherri's develop is broken because she is using prod api (can't use docker) - Aapeli will make the api less secure for now

- Aapeli could spin up a staging server but this is more $$$

- Aapeli wants to buy couchers.dev - should he? Opinions are mixed

## What are we working on

- Darren - Friends (with react query + tests)

- Sherri - Tag styling, then carousel

- Lucas - finish location jail, switch auth to use context, migrate to react-query
