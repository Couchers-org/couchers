# Web Frontend meeting November 8 2021

Present: Aapeli, Darren, Lucas, Ricardo

## Discussion
- React-snap PR outstanding issues:
  - https://web-feature-react-snap--web.preview.couchershq.org/login flashes 404 page and has a weird redirect
  - https://web-feature-react-snap--web.preview.couchershq.org/login/ works

  - How to serve 404s? Must consider /user/username for not logged in case
  - Serve 200.html instead of 404.html to avoid 404 flash for existing (but unauthenticated) pages

- Change MapboxGL for Leaflet? Probably not

- Event pages with react-snap

- Discussion about server-side rendering for dynamic pages

  - Cron job for react-snap?

  - Migrate to NextJS?

    - ToastUI editor is not very compatible with SSR

    - But it also has bad accessibility

  - React.RenderToString?
