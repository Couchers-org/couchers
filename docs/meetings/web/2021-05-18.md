# Frontend meeting 18 May 2021

Present: Aapeli, Darren, James, Jesus, Lucas, Thomas

## Discussion

- James has joined, welcome!

- Lucas will give Jesus a styling-related issue

- Darren has been doing discussions

- Thomas is combining home/profile

  - Discussion about how to implement profile routes so /profile/about and /profile/lucas/about both work

- Thomas still has frontend test errors - will post in slack

- Itsi wants to change signup flow, Lucas thinks it sounds over-complicated

## Mobile app discussion
- Choices: PWA, React Native, Flutter, (no native android/ios, not enough resources)

- PWA

  - No or limited separate code
  
  - Nothing to lose by implementing
  
  - Needs webview wrapper like cordova for ios push notifications/app store presence

- RN

  - Shares hooks and business logic but not UI
  
  - UI should be different anyway

- Flutter

  - same problem as vue, not many developers (but neither has RN)
  
  - less mature libraries (no proper equivalent for react-query)
  
  - better performance than above two
