# Web meeting 27th Jan 2022

**Present:** Aapeli, Darren, Lucas, Noemie

## Discussion

- SEO
  - Remove automatic language redirects
  - 2 options for couchers.org
    - "Language select" landing page: gives more even SEO reputation to different languages (most users use search and will go directly to their langauge anyway)
    - English page and easy to change langauges: less friction for users, prioritises English page for SEO reputation
    - Noemie is writing notes and we will let product leads decide what to try first - can change later based on data
  - Server-side generation - which pages should have public version? (Profile to start, gradual rollout with easy opt-out)

- Lucas will take over landing page/app merge
- Darren will look at some recent high-priority bugs
