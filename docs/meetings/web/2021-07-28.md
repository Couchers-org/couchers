# Frontend meeting 28 August 2021

**Present:** Aapeli, Darren, James, Lucas

## Discussion
- Done signup
- Read-only events done
- Talking about maps and how to work the frontend ux with backend to avoid #1676
  - AirBnB just doesn't show everything first - map pins are paginated the same as results
  - Need to think about how search workings with the map in general
  - Bounding box instead of point and radius for search?
- Self-service contributing encouragement

## We are working on
- Darren: Put discussions in events, dropdown attending button
- Lucas: cookies, omni-search?
- James is moving but will close his issue
