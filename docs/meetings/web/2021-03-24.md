# Frontend meeting 24 March 2021

Present: Aapeli, Chris, Darren, Lucas

## Soft beta milestone progress

**Should be able to release soon - hopefully a week**

- Update references to use the new API in references.proto - in review

- User's age is not checked on sign up backend bug - backend issue, move to beta

- Group chat view doesn't scroll to bottom when you send a new message bug frontend -
Josh is working on it - but we can move to beta

- EditUserLocationMap can't edit on mobile bug frontend mobile - in review

- Put the logo in and update the palette - in review

- Host request view doesn't give request info - awaiting merge

- Host Requests - being worked on / review

- Change login/signup picture - Lucas will bug the design team

- Requests Beta UX - Lucas will clarify the issue (and do it?)

### New issues to make

- Hide communities stuff in the soft beta map

- Events page placeholder

- Signup map submits when pressing enter - needs to not be in <form>

## Beta maps ui discussion

- Think about how to split up map

  - Not easy, just one person should start it initially

- Router state can set initial filter (because search may need to be within a community)

- Only user search has community/area filter so far in backend

### Recommended approach

Display everything in a layer like the soft beta map does (big geojson), and when a search is performed, pass the result ids to the layer as a filter.

## Other discussion

- Padding between text fields in login/signup

- We should move radius editing from map to a slider in profile settings (just have 500m default or something in signup)

- Transitions are nice

- We should use milestones more, it's nice
