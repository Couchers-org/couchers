# Future of Map meeting

When: 13/6/24, 20:00 UTC.
Present: Aapeli, David, Jesse, Krishna, Yannic

# Notes

* Jesse presents older mockups of a possible map design for mobile and desktop events
  - Searchbar with filter icon next to it for more advanced filtering
  - Pills for limiting to hosts/events/communities/POIs in the top or to select “all”
  - Pins on the map for individual results
  - On search a list of search results appears as cards, can be dragged up for full view on mobile
  - On click on a pin details of the pin are displayed as a card
* Proposal by David to implement “search in this area” button to search for hosts/events/communities in current viewport - general agreement that this is
* Aapeli brings up issue of currently having a memory-intensive map when loading all users at the same time in start view of the whole earth (right now around 6MB)
  - proposal to serve pre-computed results over tiled layer at different zoom levels from the backend
    * discussion if, when zoomed out, these will be clustered to reduce memory-load on the frontend
    * discussion that currently a lot of data is fetched initially, but during scrolling, it only depends on client-side. In proposed setup, the data exchanges would be much smaller, but on zoom, there might be a little delay when requesting new data from the backend
      - Aapeli mentions that individualized data will only be served for a fairly zoomed-in viewport. Before that all clustering at previous zoom layers could be fetched once on load and cached on the backend to be served near-instantly
    * A job should re-calculate clusters on a regular basis
    * PostGIS could create binary Mapbox vector tiles that the backend could serve directly
      - In MapLibre it is possible to define zoom ranges at which tiles appear
* David mentions the need for a backend endpoint to return users for a rectangular selection
* Aapeli mentions that there is an existing omni-search for ?
* Krishna mentions that the filter-parameters in the search are quite limited (no filter for gender/language) - partly these exist on the backend, but are not implemented on the frontend -> David could work on these in the frontend
* Highlighting which communities are in the viewport
  - Jesse: with a pill in the top to show pins within this community
  - Aapeli: Show link to community to promote communities
  - Jesse: highlight different levels of communities at different zoom levels - first country level, on zoom in city communities
* Proposal for listing of results in map (when “All” pill is checked)
  - First, highlighting of community - “hey, looks like you are in the New York community…”
  - Second events?
    * discussion if this is overbearing - Jesse feels that people would click the pill/a pin anyway
    * Aapeli proposes events being mixed in for discoverability
  - Then users?
* Conclusion: Tickets will be created for main tasks
  - Pre-computed user clusters to reduce memory load of webpage
  - Viewport search
  - Pills on top of search to limit to hosts/events/communities
  - Expanding of filter options
