# Backend team meeting #13

When: 23/12/20, 22:00 UTC
Attending: Aapeli, Henri, Lucas, Marco

## Notes

* Not much to discuss as a lot was discussed in local communities chat yesterday
* Aapeli: currently three strands of backend dev: core stuff, communities stuff, and larger refactoring stuff
* Brief discussion about mapping stuff
* Marco: backend APIs are very low-level and require a lot of queries to do basic stuff, e.g. not returning all user info, just ID. Aapeli: for now we've been doing low-level and will look at bridging the two later.
