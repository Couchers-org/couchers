# Reported content reference (content_ref)

When content is reported by the *reporting user* to admins, the report includes information about the *author user* of that content, as well as a *content reference*.

The content reference, or `content_ref`, is a reference that uniquely identifies a piece of content and helps the admin or moderator find the flagged content. It is in many aspects similar to the path in a URL, but sometimes a page has several different pieces of content that are not uniquely identified by the page. For example, a discussion will have multiple comment on the same page.

This page documents the `content_ref`s currently in use.

## User profile
