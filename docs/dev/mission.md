# Mission statement and values

Couchers.org is an online platform for the global couch surfing community. We aim to connect travellers with hosts around the world, without the involvement of money, and by doing so facilitate the growth and strengthening of local and global communities.

* We believe in the value of genuine human interactions based on generosity, the desire for friendship and cultural experiences, safety, and trust in others; and not motivated by monetary or other transactions.

* Couchers.org is built with the time, expertise and experience of its community. We encourage community members to contribute to the platform where they can. It is necessary for users to continuously engage with and steer the evolution of the platform in order to guarantee its continuity and health. Funding and contributions will only ever be accepted from the community.

* We believe in the value of communities, and of belonging to communities.

* We strongly believe that monetization is at odds with the philosophy of couch surfing. There should be no exchange of money between hosts and surfers. Similarly, the platform should never seek to profit and never exclude users from any of its functionality based on payment.

* In order for the platform to be useful, it must continuously evolve with the needs of the community and be built to a high standard. The platform is a tool for the community; unlike for-profit, ad-funded platforms, our objective is to maximise real-world engagement in favor of digital engagement.
