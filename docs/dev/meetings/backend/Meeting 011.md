# Backend team meeting #11

When: 25/11/20, 22:00 UTC
Attending: Aapeli, Christian, Itsi, Kamiel, Lucas, Marco, Tina

## Notes

* Discussed some open PRs briefly
    - Running migrations in tests vs create_all(): add a config variable and run both test sets in CI
* How to get some new contributors more engaged and get them up and running well: can we have some non-devs be in touch over slack as well?
* CI stuff has been setup, nice PR previews and tests are being run, Aapeli will add frontend tests into CI when Darren finishes adding some
* Lucas brought up a point about how we should start polishing off some of the rough edges and bringing the UI to parity with designs in smaller details: this should be done systematically; adding new issues for individual differences may be the way to go
* Claudio will look at story book on frontend testing and QA, we will need to do another set of intense testing when react reaches feature parity with vue frontend
