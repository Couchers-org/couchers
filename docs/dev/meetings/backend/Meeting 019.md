# Backend team meeting #19

When: 17/3/21, 20:00 UTC
Attending: Aapeli, Claudio, Sam

## Notes

* Time zone confusion, people not present/late
* Omer: working time zone support for app
* Sam: regions visited
* Claudio asks about what's important for testing: signup flow on any device, events (not yet implemented)
* Claudio asks about whether to do performance testing, try to break the db or whether he should concentrate on frontend for now: concentrate on frontend, we will run into slow queries but only after some actual usage and then we'll add indexes, tune, etc
