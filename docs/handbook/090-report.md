# How do I report someone or something that violates the Community Guidelines or Terms of Use (ToU)?

## Option 1

1. Click on the flag symbol (located below their profile photo or profile circle if they have no photo).
2. Select the reason from the dropdown menu.
3. Fill out the form with further details (OPTIONAL, but very helpful!)
4. Click "Submit".

## Option 2

Send an email to [safety@couchers.org](mailto:safety@couchers.org). If you send an email, be sure to include the following information:

1. Your username.
2. The username of the person you are reporting (or a link to their profile).
3. Provide as many details about what happened as possible.

**Note:** If you're not sure if something is a violation or not, it is better to just report it. The support team will review the report before any action is taken.
