# How can I leave a reference for someone?

## After hosting or staying with someone

1. Click "Messages".
2. Click "hosting" or "surfing" (depending on which type of reference you are leaving).
3. Click on the request you want to leave a reference for.
4. Click the "Write reference" button.

## A friend

1. On your friendâ€™s profile, click on "References".
2. Click on "Write Reference".

Note: You must have sent or received a friend request, which was also confirmed, before you can leave a reference for a friend.

## A stranger or acquaintance

Currently you cannot leave a reference for someone you are not friends with. However, no matter what the situation is, you can always [report the person](#report) or email [safety@couchers.org](mailto:safety@couchers.org).
