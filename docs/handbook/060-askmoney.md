# Can I ask for money, gifts, donations, services or work when interacting with other people on Couchers.org?

No. Keep things non-transactional. Don't exchange money, goods, work, donations, or services while staying, hosting, or meeting up. Couchers.org is about learning, experiences, and getting to know people.
