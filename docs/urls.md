# URL plan

This file specifies the URL format of various resources within
couchers. It is recommended that frontends use these URLs whenever a
resource is shared outside the frontend. The slug is the part after
the ID number and it should be ignored when parsing the URL.

This file also describes URLs included in all emails that is sent by
the couchers server. For more information, see discussion in
