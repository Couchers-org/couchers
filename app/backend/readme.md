# Couchers.org app backend

[Here is information for debugging the backend inside VS Code](/docs/backend-in-vscode.md)

You can run the whole thing through Docker and docker-compose (see the readme in the `app/` folder).

## Running tests in docker

You can run all tests in docker with the following command, executed in the `app` folder:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

## Running tests locally

1. If you haven't already, run the first two steps from the [readme in the `app/` folder](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/blob/develop/app/readme.md).

**Remember** that if you've made changes to any \*.proto files, you may need to re-compile the protocol buffers (step 2).

2. Make sure the postgres_tests container is running:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up postgres_tests
```

3. Create a virtual environment and enter it, then install the requirements.

```sh
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set the necessary env vars:

```sh
export DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://postgres:06b3890acd2c235c41be0bbfe22f1b386a04bf02eedf8c977486355616be2aa1@localhost:6544/postgres
```

**Windows** note: Replace "export" with "set"

(Environment variables are non-persistent and must be set in the exact place where you plan to run the tests. For example, if using an IDE, they must be set within the IDE.)

6. Run `pytest` in the `app/backend/src/` folder.

```sh
cd src..
pytest
```

## Q/A:

Q: When running tests python is not connecting to the db. What do I do?

A: Doublecheck that your DB test container is running. Then make sure the DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING is similar to the one set in `backend.test.env`. Besides `localhost` it should be the same - if it is different the docs may be out of date. Please submit a PR to fix the docs.

Q: I can't connect to the DB!

A: First doublecheck what port the DB is listening on - run `docker-compose up postgres` and it should say something like `listening on IPv6 address "::", port 6545`. Then doublecheck you have the right password. There are TWO passwords - one for the test db and one for the normal db! See app/postgres.dev.env and app/postgres.test.env
