Hi {{ user.name }}!

You have {{ days_left }} days left to write a reference for {{ other_user.name }} from when you {% if surfed %}surfed with{% else %}hosted{% endif %} them.

Leave a reference here:

<{{ leave_reference_link|couchers_safe }}>

You can also leave a reference by going to the Messaging tab, locating the request, then clicking on the "Write Reference" button at the bottom of the conversation.

It's a nice gesture to write references and helps us build a community together! References will become visible 2 weeks after the stay, or when you've both written a reference for each other, whichever happens first.

Thanks for using Couchers!
