Hi {{ user.name }}!

{{ from_user.name }} just wrote a reference for you from when you {% if surfed %}surfed with{% else %}hosted{% endif %} them.

{% if both_written %}
This is what they wrote:

{{ text|v2quote }}

Thanks for using Couchers to organize this interaction! We hope you had an enjoyable, fulfilling time.

You can see the reference on your profile: <{{ profile_references_link }}>
{% else %}
Please go and write a reference for them too. It's a nice gesture and helps us build a community together! When you've both written a reference, both references will become visible. Otherwise {{ from_user.name }}'s reference will become visible 2 weeks after the end of your interaction, after which you cannot write a reference back.

You can write a reference for {{ from_user.name }} here:

<{{ leave_reference_link }}>
{% endif %}
