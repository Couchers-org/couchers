These are the v2 email templates, using something called MJML (can be tested in [MJML Live editor](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/)).

Each template should have a `.txt` and an `.mjml`. The latter are generated into `generated_html/` and at the moment should be committed to git.

Update with:

```
./_build.sh
```
