    Queues a notification given the notification and a target, i.e. a tuple (user_id, topic, key), and an action.

    Notifications are sent to user identified by user_id, and are collapsed/grouped based on the combination of
    (topic, key).

    For example, topic may be "chat" for a group chat/direct message, and the key might be the chat id; so that messages
    in the same group chat show up in one group.

    The action is a simple identifier describing the action that caused the notification. For the above example, the
    action might be "add_admin" if the notification was caused by another user adding an admin into the gorup chat.
