You must agree to these Terms to access the Couchers.org services and create an account.

*This is version 2.3 of the Terms of Service, last updated on 12th of June, 2024.*


# 1. Service provider

Access to the Couchers.org platform ("platform", "service") is provided to you by **Couchers, Inc.** ("Couchers.org", "we", "us"), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization incorporated in the United States.


# 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old and a natural person to access the service.

You are not permitted to have, create, maintain, access, or use multiple accounts at a time on the service. If you are restricted from accessing the platform via a ban, suspension, or any other method, you may not create a new account. If you are in good standing, you may delete your account and sign up again later.


# 3. Account information

You are responsible for any activity done using your account, as well as securing your account from inappropriate access. For example, you must use a secure password not shared across other products or services, and you cannot leave your account logged in on shared computers. If you give access to your account to others for any purpose, you are liable for any such activity.

You must provide truthful and current information on your account. Your display name does not need to be your legal name and your display location does not need to be your true location. You may hide or obfuscate information on your public profile for your own privacy or security, but you may not do so in a way that would reasonably deceive other users. Information used in verification must be truthful and accurate, this includes your birth date, your gender identity, your legal name, and your verification address.


# 4. Liability and your interactions with others

Couchers.org provides a platform for users to contact one another and organize activities together. You agree to not hold us liable or responsible for user-created content or for interactions between users, including online and in person. You are solely liable and responsible for your actions on the platform, including any interactions with other users and any content that you create.

Although we are not legally responsible for user-created content, we actively moderate the platform to remove any content that is harmful, deceitful, or otherwise does not adhere to our rules. If you believe some content does not adhere to our rules, please report it to us via safety@couchers.org, or via the flagging feature on the platform.

When posting any image, you agree to obtain consent from any individual pictured in the image.

We are not liable if at any time, with or without prior notice, we modify, suspend or discontinue our services or your access to our services.


# 5. Data privacy and security

We collect data required to provide you with the service, such as your profile information, your email address, and other data. We use cookies to keep you logged in. We take the protection of your data very seriously. All communication between you and the platform is encrypted with transport security (SSL/TLS), and data is stored securely on servers in accordance with industry standards.

We want to make Couchers.org the best platform possible, so we additionally collect analytics data for the following reasons: to help us grow the platform (by finding out what kind of content and services appeal to users), to help us fix bugs and improve the experience for you and other users (e.g. so we can spend time on features you actually use), and for purposes of user safety and content moderation (e.g. to understand usage patterns by adversarial users).

The analytics data we collect includes things like how users found us, what pages they read before signing up, what features they use on the platform, as well as debugging information such as: automated bug reporting, analytics on error rates, exception rates, and timings of different backend functionality. We believe this is necessary for the purpose of getting a full view into how the site is used and what the community wants from the platfrom. For now we use third-party tools for the client-side analytics, but we would like to build our own tooling to be able to better tailor it to the platform, please let us know if you would like to help us in this effort!

We do not sell any user data and will only use or process it for purposes in line with our policies as well as our non-profit, community-led mission.


# 6. Our service providers

Our platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and we use a variety of their products to provide this service to you, including hosting our servers, storing our backups, and sending emails.

We use Google Analytics for analytics purposes. We use Google Workspace for our email hosting, Sentry for automatic bug reports, and GitHub for code hosting and bug reports.

We may add additional service providers as needed, and will make an effort to update this document.


# 7. Termination

If you are in breach of these terms or any other rules, guidelines, or policies in place, we may, at our discretion, suspend or terminate your account.


# 8. Additional terms for Strong Verification

This section contains additional terms for those members who complete Strong Verification. Strong Verification is an optional safety feature that allows you to verify your profile information by scanning a Biometric passport with a supported NFC enabled device.

We use a trusted third-party application called [Iris ID](https://passportreader.app/) by Iris Development AB to read your passport if you choose to complete Strong Verification. The app processes your data and verifies it before passing it back to our server. As per their [Privacy policy](https://passportreader.app/privacy), they will delete your personal information within 24 hours. By completing Strong Verification, you agree to be bound by their [Privacy policy](https://passportreader.app/privacy) and [Terms & conditions](https://passportreader.app/terms).

When you complete Strong Verification, the data retrieved from your passport is encrypted with an asymmetric keypair in such a way that the server can no longer access it. There is a mechanism for this data to be decrypted and retrieved manually, but the key is stored separately offline and requires human intervention to use. The following information is additionally stored on the server for continued verification purposes: country of nationality, sex, date of birth, passport expiry date, and the last three digits of the passport number.

You can request for this Strong Verification data (except for the minimal anti-abuse data) to be deleted from our servers at any time.

The minimal anti-abuse data of nationality, passport expiry date, and the last three digits of the passport number is stored for all successful verifications and cannot be removed. This data is used for safety and moderation purposes, for example, to prevent banned users from creating new accounts. We believe this is an appropriate compromise between providing a safe platform for our users, while not storing sensitive personal information beyond what you wish to share with the platform and other users.
