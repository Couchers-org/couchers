## Like Couchsurfing™, but better

Couchers.org is a **non-profit and free** platform, **built by volunteers** and responsible to the couch surfing community, instead of investors. Formed after Couchsurfing™ put up its paywall in 2020, our goal is to **reclaim couch surfing** by creating a **complete alternative**, with all your **favourite features**.

Couchers.org is the **fastest growing** couch surfing platform. We have built the **largest active volunteer base** with over 40 skilled contributors. Our product teams are designing and developing the platform at blazing speed, releasing **new features every two weeks**; our community teams are planning out and executing user base growth and engagement strategies to reach a **critical mass of quality couch surfers** with active local communities and a vibrant global discussion.

## Our plan: fix the problems with Couchsurfing™

We're sure that you, like all of us, have had great experiences that couldn't have happened without Couchsurfing™. But we all know it's got its issues. For the next generation in couch surfing apps, we need to fix those issues.

If there's any problems you've found with Couchsurfing™ or any other platforms, we'd love to hear about it so we can try to fix them.

## The problems with Couchsurfing™

### Governance

##### [Profit incentives](/about/solutions/profit-and-incentives)

Couchsurfing™ is explicitly for-profit, prioritizing returns for investors over users and communities.

##### [Neglected communities](/about/issues/communities-and-trust)

The community has been ignored, too many users have been pushed onto the platform, trust between members has been eroded.

### Design

##### [Safety](/about/issues/creeps-and-freeloaders)

Detrimental users threaten users' safety, especially for women. Freeloaders abound.

##### [Reference system](/about/issues/reviews)

You can't trust people based on references.

##### [Super-host effect](/about/issues/host-matching)

Local communities have been shrinking to just small groups of super-hosts.

### Technology

##### [The bugs and app issues](/about/issues/the-build)

There are far too many bugs and problems with the Couchsurfing™ platform. It wasn't good enough as a free service, and it's definitely not good enough now that it's paid.

## Our plan for the next-generation couch surfing platform

### Governance

#### [Non-profit structure](/about/solutions/profit-and-incentives)

This platform will be run as a non-profit, taking no outside investment. The priorities will be the users and community.

#### [Community-first framework](/about/solutions/communities-and-trust)

We will build communities into the foundations of the product, and improve trust through a new verification method.

### Design

#### [Member accountability](/about/solutions/creeps-and-freeloaders)

Users will be accountable for how they treat other members, filtering out creeps and freeloaders.

#### [Improved review system](/about/solutions/reviews)

Overhauled references to reflect more accurately on users.

#### [Better host finding](/about/solutions/host-matching)

Healthier communities by spreading out hosting opportunities and no message limits.

### Technology

#### [Build it right](/about/solutions/the-build)

Our platform is developer-led. We will build this right, make it scalable, and listen to the community to fix bugs. We want to make something to be proud of.
