The reference system used by Couchsurfing&#8482; may seem simple and intuitive on the surface, but it fails to do its job. **People read references for two main reasons: to make sure their experience is 1) safe and 2) enjoyable.** However, given the way the reference system is structured, it **doesn't achieve either of these goals** and so the system is meaningless.

In general, a good user account is one that only has positive reviews. Negative (and previously neutral) reviews are seen as red flags. The norm is to leave a good review, which is understandable, especially in situations where a host has generously let you stay in their home and treated you well. However, there's a problem here in that it's hard to distinguish between an average experience with someone just letting you crash at their place or an amazing experience with someone who's a great asset to the community. As most references are similarly positive, it's very hard to gauge whether you think you'll have an enjoyable experience with another person. **But the larger problem is in how uncommon negative reviews are.** What this has done is consolidated members onto the 100% positive bracket whether they are great contributors to the community or detract from it. There's no way to tell from references.

**The threshold for how bad an experience must be for someone to justify leaving a bad review is far too high, and so the vast majority of negative experiences are never reported, and so do not factor into the public references.** [People are confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/coknjp/is_it_justified_to_post_this_negative_reference/) about [when to write negative reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/erd3yl/should_i_write_a_negative_review_for_this_person/), especially in situations where they are [made to feel uncomfortable](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/fczu80/when_to_write_a_bad_review/). In many situations, they might not leave a review, or sometimes will even leave a good one. There is encouragement for people to use negative or neutral reviews more, but [incentives were never aligned to make them commonly used](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/214p4j/anyone_else_a_little_bothered_by_the_review/cg9mcq1/). The topic of the reference system [being broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/bjsv7h/the_reference_system_of_cs_looks_somehow_broken/) comes up frequently, and has led people to [not trust reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/adlq58/recent_experiences_with_good_profiles_are_making/), even if [someone has many](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/). **This is an issue as it means that the reference system does [not make people accountable](/issues/creeps-and-freeloaders).**

Negative reviews are seen as a big punishment, and people feel uncomfortable punishing others. Often in these cases, a negative review seems disproportionate to a problem that might not have been 'that bad' (for instance, they were made to feel a bit uncomfortable). Negative references are stigmatized. It is the norm for users to have 100% positive reviews, any lower and it is much harder to meet people. There is a huge difference between 100% and 98% positive reviews. However, if people's scores were normally in the 60-80% region, then giving a negative review wouldn't be that big of a deal. There's not that much of a difference between 75% and 73%.

Although Couchsurfing&#8482; doesn't publish references until both parties have made them, it is still intimidating to leave a negative public record. **The stigmatization of negative reviews stops many people from writing one** out of fear of confrontation or retaliation if they see that person again, or if they themselves are left a negative personal reference in response. There need to be anonymous ways to signal a bad experience.
