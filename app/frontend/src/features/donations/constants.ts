export const DONATIONS_TEXT = `Couchers.org is a community-run non-profit that is funded by donations, similar to Wikipedia. There are no venture capitalists or private interests, just hard-working people building something that will make the world a bit of a better place.

We believe that there is enough goodwill in the couch surfing community to create a platform that will easily outcompete Couchsurfing™. And that we can do this while promising to be free for everyone forever without making our users the product.

But **we need your help** to do so.

Your donation to Couchers.org is a highly efficient investment that goes directly into critical expenses. Where services like Couchsurfing™ spend huge amounts on hiring and third party services, we are staffed by volunteers and rely on open-source software, so we can effectively stretch out the revenue we receive.

If you believe in this mission, then we ask you to donate. And we ask you to consider the value of couch surfing to your own life, and how important it is to spread that to others in the world. Please consider making a donation of $5, $20, $50, or whatever you can in order to achieve our common goal.

Thanks,

Aapeli Vuorinen and Itsi Weinstock<br />Couchers.org Founders`;
