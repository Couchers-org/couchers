We believe that there is enough good will in the couch surfing community to build a platform that will easily outcompete Couchsurfing, and restore ownership to all of us.

Couchsurfing was built by the community, and we fully intend to put it back in their hands by building an amazing product. We need your help to do so.

[Couchers.org](https://couchers.org) is a place to connect with others, not a place to run advertising.
The core of [Couchers.org](https://couchers.org) is a community of people acting out of complete generosity, having real human experiences free of any transactions.

We made some promises on day one:
- **We will be free to use forever**
- **We will never run advertisements**
- **We will never sell data**
- **Our code will always be open source**

We made these promises so that [Couchers.org](https://couchers.org) can be the best possible platform that it can be. But in order to do that, we need your support.

If you believe in this mission, then we ask you to donate. And we ask you to consider the value of couch surfing to your own life, and how important it is to spread that to others in the world. Please consider making a donation of $5, $20, $50, or whatever you can in order to achieve our common goal.

Thanks,
Itsi Weinstock and Aapeli Vuorinen
[Couchers.org](https://couchers.org) Founders`;
