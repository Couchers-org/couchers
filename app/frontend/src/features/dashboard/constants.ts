You'll be able to voice your thoughts, opinions, concerns & compliments, and any other feedback you have.

The Open Town Hall will be an opportunity for you to meet the Core Team and ask us any questions about the project, our direction, our roadmap, the state of development, what we're working on, and what we're currently prioritizing. The event will be open to everyone, and will run every fourth Sunday of the month from 14:00 UTC to 15:00 UTC.

The meeting will start with a brief update on progress in the last month, and will then continue in a Question & Answer style where members of the community will have a chance to ask questions and we will do our best to answer them. Brief minutes will be posted on our blog after each meeting.

The events are held on Zoom at this link: [https://couchers.org/town-hall](https://couchers.org/town-hall).

## Community features

We're working on releasing events, which we'll roll out gradually in the coming updates.

If you are interested in becoming a community builder, it's not too late to reach out to us by filling in the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute). If you are already heavily involved in a local travel community, please also reach out.

## Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We've started our mobile development team, but are still looking for contributors to join and help on development of the app, if you're interested, please fill in the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute).

We aim to get Beta quality apps out by the end of this year.

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

# Bugs

Bugs are to be expected, as we are still in a phase of rapid development. We appreciate you being here to help with that. If you notice any bugs, please report them with the red button in the top right corner.

Please discuss anything else about the app on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/).`;
