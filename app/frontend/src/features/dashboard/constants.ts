You'll be able to voice your thoughts, opinions, concerns & compliments, and any other feedback you have.

The Open Town Hall will be an opportunity for you to meet the Core Team and ask us any questions about the project, our direction, our roadmap, the state of development, what we're working on, and what we're currently prioritizing. The event will be open to everyone, and will run every fourth Sunday of the month from 14:00 UTC to 15:00 UTC.

The meeting will start with a brief update on progress in the last month, and will then continue in a Question & Answer style where members of the community will have a chance to ask questions and we will do our best to answer them. Brief minutes will be posted on our blog after each meeting.

The events are held on Zoom at this link: [https://couchers.org/town-hall](https://couchers.org/town-hall).

## Events and community builders

We have started releasing parts of the events feature. For now, events are created by admins manually, but we will add functionality for creating and editing events on the platform in the next releases. If you'd like to create an event, please get in touch!

We have started looking for Community Builders: couch surfers who want to grow their local community on the Couchers.org platform. They are responsible for creating content for their community, and bringing new users, and will form the backbone of the community growth plan. If you'd like to help build your local community, please fill in the [Community Builder form](https://couchers.org/community-builder-form).

## Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We've started our mobile development team, but are still looking for contributors to join and help on development of the app, if you're interested, please fill in the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute).

We aim to get Beta quality apps out by the end of this year.

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

# Bugs

Bugs are to be expected, as we are still in a phase of rapid development. We appreciate you being here to help with that. If you notice any bugs, please report them with the red button in the top right corner.

Please discuss anything else about the app on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/).`;

**Tell your friends**: If anyone you know would be excited about this new platform, please tell them! If they're active couch surfers and you trust them, we want them here!

**Social media**: Spread the word on your social media platforms. If you are part of any groups or discussions (e.g. Facebook or WhatsApp groups), please post there. Even better, try to talk to moderators and convert existing groups to include Couchers.org, like they did in the [Chicago community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cschicago/).

**Talk about us at events**: If you head to any events listed on other couch surfing platforms, mention us to people there!

**YouTubers, Bloggers, Influencers and Media**: If you know any people out there making videos, blogs, or posts about couch surfing or travel in general, talk to them and see if they would like to make any content about the platform. Get in contact with local news outlets or magazines and see if they would be interested in hearing about Couchers.org.`;
