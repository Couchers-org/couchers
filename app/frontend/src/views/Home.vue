          <h1>Welcome to the Couchers.org Alpha!</h1>
          <p>
            REMEMBER: THIS PLATFORM IS IN ALPHA STAGE - IT IS NOT COMPLETE -
            THIS IS FOR ONGOING TESTING
          </p>
          <p>THIS IS <b>NOT THE DESIGN</b> OF THE FINAL PLATFORM</p>
          <p>
            REPORT: <b>BUGS</b> ARE TO BE EXPECTED - PLEASE REPORT THEM WITH THE
            RED BUTTON IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER
          </p>
          <p>
            DATA: WE WILL <b>WIPE ALL ACCOUNTS</b> AND DATA ON OR BEFORE LAUNCH
            OF THE PLATFORM
          </p>
          <p>
            The Alpha works best on a computer, but not quite yet on a small
            phone screen!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Alpha is a bit small on features and a bit buggy, but we're
            opening it up to the forum so we can share the exciting path that
            we're traveling down. We're quite proud of how much the volunteers
            have been able to achieve in just a couple of months.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is happening! We're going to have a free and functional
            platform that's full of features AND which is non-profit and
            ingrained adequately into the community. We're actively developing
            the platform, so you can check back in whenever you like to see any
            new features, upgrades and bug fixes. We're working towards a
            zero-downtime upgrade process which will be used before the proper
            launch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please keep in mind that this is just an alpha version. We know it's
            buggy, and we know it's a bit ugly and clunky. Please help out by
            poking around and reporting anything that's not working. We hope
            you'll be the one using it, so use this opportunity to give feedback
            and share what would work best for you.
          </p>
