title: Governance and Leadership Structure
---

This document outlines the powers and responsibilities of different members of the organization, and how decisions are made.

In brief, at the highest level is the **Board** who appoint the **Executive Director** (ED) who is primarily responsible for running the organization. The ED may appoint a **Steering Group** (SG) to help with decision making processes and delegation of responsibilities.

Most responsibilities will fall into one of four departments: **Product**, **Operations**, **Marketing**, and **Community**. Each department has a **Department Head**, and coordinates the various constituent teams, each with a **Team Lead**. Department Heads are members of the Steering Group.

## Decision Making Process

Given our need to be asynchronous and make the most of limited time and resources, **we favor people taking initiative over needing approval**. As long as something is within someone’s scope, they should feel empowered to make a decision on it. We want people to not feel blocked at any point by the decision making process, and we accept the reality that mistakes will be made by doing this.

Reporting and authority on decision making is structured as:

<p style="text-align: center;">Executive Director > Department Head > Team Lead > Team Member</p>

To make a decision a person **does not need approval** from someone with more authority. However, someone with more authority may override their decision. Voting and excessive meetings about decision making should be avoided.

There are many cases where it is unclear if the decision falls within the scope of a person’s responsibilities. In those cases, that person should consult with the person they report to, and if necessary re-clarify their scope.

For this to work, we need to consider:
- communication and consultation must be high. While no one needs authority, it is still worth discussing things over slack and the forum, especially when there will be significant impact.
- we will **make mistakes**, and decisions will need to be overridden. No one should feel bad in these situations, it is a good outcome, as it means people are taking action and pushing things forward. People must be frank with one another when this happens.
- **scope must be clearly defined**. If anyone is unsure about their responsibilities, this should be quickly corrected so people know what they should be taking initiative over.

## Responsibilities

### The Board

The Board is a supervisory body that ensures that the organization is on the right path to sustainably meet its mission and vision, which it also sets. It is removed from the executive decisions of the organization, and acts to provide stability to the organization. It vests its authority in the Executive Director and other potential executive roles, and has the power to select and dismiss them.

The Board meets at least once a quarter. It should be removed from the day-to-day operations of the organization, but provides high level strategy and advises those carrying out executive tasks.

For now, there are 3 members on the board: Aapeli, Dea, and Itsi. We plan to gradually grow the board, aiming for around 8 to 12 members. The composition should have some members who are actively involved in carrying out the mission, but we aim to find experienced people who can bring their experience and perspectives to the high level strategy of the organization.

### Executive Director

The ED receives their authority from the board, and is the primary person responsible for executing the mission and vision of the organization, leading the team and making executive decisions.

The ED has significant powers, and is held accountable by the Board. Volunteers and Members may appeal to the Board as a check on these powers.

### Steering Group

The SG is the core executive body of the organization. It is appointed by and run by the ED. It makes practical decisions for the execution of the mission, and leads the core team. Although the ED can and does make executive decisions, it is prudent to consult with this body to come to consensus and delegate ownership of tasks.

In general, it is composed of very active members of the organization who have significant responsibilities, and who should be consulted in regular decision making. Members of the SG hold each other accountable for commitments to their responsibilities, and contribute to cross-departmental decision making.

### Department Heads
We can separate most regular responsibilities into one of four departments: Product, Operations, Marketing, and Community. Each department has a Department Head who operates it, setting its plan and making sure that plan is carried out. Department Heads report to and work closely with the ED.

Each department has constituent teams. The Department Head represents those teams on the SG, and works with the teams to make sure tasks are being effectively delegated. The Department Head is responsible for the management of the team members in that department.

### Team Leads

Each department will have teams within it that carry out the execution of tasks. Each team has a Team Lead, who sets a plan for that team in coordination with the Department Head, and ensures tasks are prioritized and executed. They also assist with recruiting for that team.
