title: New Developer Guide
---

Welcome to the Couchers.org development team! We would love to work with you on building this platform for our community.

The **three steps** to getting started are:

* **Step 1**: tackle your first issue on GitHub
* **Step 2**: meet with core contributors over a video call
* **Step 3**: join our biweekly development meetings

You don't have to do these in order, so feel free to join the development meetings or schedule a chat when you're ready!

## Step 1: tackle your first issue on GitHub

To get started, head to our GitHub repository and find a good first issue to get working on.

<!-- not assigned, exclude critical or high priority issues, and exclude those requiring work from the other "end" -->
* [Backend good first issues](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abackend+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+-label%3Aweb+-label%3A%22priority%3A+critical%22+-label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22+no%3Aassignee)
* [Web frontend good first issues](https://github.com/Couchers-org/web-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee)

**Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on it**, and one of the core developers will assign it to you. Feel free to ask any questions in that issue's comments and we'll do our best to help you get going.

Once you're ready, open a Pull Request and core developers will come to review your code.

### Resources to get you started

Start by setting up a development environment, there is a step-by-step guide at <https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/tree/develop/app#readme>. For setting up just the web frontend, you can follow the [web readme](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/tree/develop/app/web#readme). We also have a [general developer contributor guide](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/blob/develop/docs/contributing.md) outlining the GitHub workflow and other parts. The [architecture overview document](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/blob/develop/docs/architecture.md) outlines how the different parts of the app work together. For backend developers, there is an [overview of how a request goes through the backend](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/blob/develop/docs/life-of-an-rpc.md).

We have plenty more documentation in the [//docs](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/tree/develop/docs) folder to help you get started. If anything is unclear or you have any trouble, just open an issue and we'll be there to help!

## Step 2: meet with core contributors over a video call

Once you've made a start digging around the codebase and found something to work on, we'd love to meet with you over video call. That way we can get to know each other, and figure out how you can best contribute to the project!

To schedule a meeting, head over to the link below and book a time:

* [Backend meeting scheduling](https://couchers.org/backend-developer-chat)
* [Frontend meeting scheduling](https://couchers.org/frontend-developer-chat)

Once we've met you on video call, we can invite you to Slack and add you as a contributor to the GitHub organization.

## Step 3: join our biweekly development meetings

We coordinate a lot of our work through meetings. Meetings are on Wednesdays at 20:00 UTC, and we alternate between backend and web meetings, so that each runs once every two weeks. Meeting notes are posted on GitHub after the meeting. You can find the calendar invites below:

* [Backend meeting calendar invite](https://couchers.org/contributors/backend-meeting.ics)
* [Frontend meeting calendar invite](https://couchers.org/contributors/web-meeting.ics)

## How to get help

Check first the documentation in the [//docs](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers/tree/develop/docs) folder. If this doesn't answer your question, open a GitHub issue and ask there, we'll be more than happy to help.
