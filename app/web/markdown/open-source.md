The driving force of Couchers is the global [volunteer team](/team), and they are the stars of the show.

That said, Couchers is an open-source project and we are very heavy users of open-source technologies ourselves. We want to give a huge shout out to the folks who have built the tools and technologies that make Couchers possible! We are also supported by some great companies that help us build and operate Couchers, whether it is because we are a non-profit or an open-source project.

## Open Source Technologies

We'd like to thank the amazing folks who built these core technologies, without which Couchers couldn't exist:

* The [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) open-source database project: this incredible project provides the backbone to Couchers!
* The [Python](https://www.python.org/) language: old & gold!
* The [React Ecosystem](https://react.dev/) that powers our web platform
* The [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) open-source projects
* The [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) geospatial extension to Postgres
* The [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) and [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/) projects that have given everyone the power to have pretty maps!
* The [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), [GeoAlchemy 2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/), and [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/) projects
* The [Material UI project](https://mui.com/), without which our website would look awful
* The [Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font) and [Mansalva](https://github.com/carolinashort/mansalva) open-source fonts
* The [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) open-source project that allows us to easily translate the site
* The [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)/[Victoriametrics](https://victoriametrics.com/)/[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) monitoring stack
* The [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) project that powers our wiki
* The [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/) open source support platform project that powers all our Support systems

## Company Sponsorships

We want to thank the following companies that provide us with freebies (either specifically because we're a non-profit/open-source, or in general to everyone):

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/): Couchers runs fully in the cloud and our hosting bills are partially offset by the generous [non-profit credit program](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/nonprofit-credit-program/) by AWS!
* [GitHub](https://github.com) hosts [all our code](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers) and is where we build Couchers (come help out by the way)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) sponsors [us](https://gitlab.com/couchers/couchers) a [very generous](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/) CI/CD allowance, allowing us to ship better software quicker!
* [Google](https://www.google.com/) sponsors us free email & drive
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) sponsors a [Sentry for Good](https://sentry.io/for/good/) plan for us to track and tackle bugs
* [Monday](https://monday.com/) sponsors us a plan that helps us organize our recruiting processes

## Past Company Sponsorships

In the past, we received generous sponsorship from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and utilized the free plan of [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) (who are also the original creators of some of the core open-source mapping technologies we rely on).
