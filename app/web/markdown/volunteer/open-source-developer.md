## Join the Couchers.org Open Source project

In order to find committed and skilled volunteers for the project, we generally recruit volunteers via an application process. We recognize that Open Source contributors find this process weird and requiring too much a priori committment. This document outlines a different way of joining the project by contributing code first so we don't waste your time on needless interviews and paperwork.

If you would like to help build Couchers.org and know how to get started contributing to open source projects, we have the following streamlined process for you:

1. Head on over to our public [Github monorepo](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers)
2. Find an open issue that you'd like to work on: look for those that are marked as good first issues or that scratch your itch
3. Set up the development environment, and get started on code changes; open a PR with your changes
4. Once your have opened your first PR, please reach out to have a chat so we can add you to Slack, Github, and invite you to the development meetings!

*We are happy to help any developer with interest in contributing to the project who has started on an issue or has started setting up their development environment. To reach out, you can contact [@aapeli](https://couchers.org/user/aapeli) on the platform, or comment on the issue you are working on.*

Note that there is no difference between those volunteers who join via the application process and those that join via the open source contribution-first model. This is merely a separate process to help us get out of the way of talented and interested developers wanting to help.

There is no commitment required to contribute in this way. We'd love to have you stick around but you don't need to agree to any commitment beforehand!
