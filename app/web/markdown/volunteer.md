## Our Team

Couchers.org is made up of a professional volunteer team, with everyone contributing their spare time. We have all kinds of positions available including in software development, marketing, design, finance, events, volunteer coordination and more!

### [Meet our volunteers](/team)

People join for many reasons, but what brings us all together is a shared set of values, and a belief in the necessity of growing Couchers.org as a new platform and community.

### [Our Plan](/plan) and [Our Mission & Values](/mission)

## The Volunteering Experience:

- **Professional development**: Work and develop your skills alongside a global network of highly skilled and committed people — with professionals in your own field and others. There are plenty of opportunities to grow your skills and mentor others, all while working on high-impact projects in a rapidly growing organization.
- **Remote work**: All work is done remotely, with everyone working to their own schedules. We maintain great documentation and asynchronous practices to make the remote experience as easy as possible.
- **Have fun and grow your network**: everyone involved is passionate and skilled with similar values in wanting to see this project succeed. We hold virtual events to make sure everyone can meet each other and have fun. As we grow, we'll be holding in-person events around the world for our volunteers as well!

We value being highly collaborative to learn together, honest and transparent, kind, welcoming, and enthusiastic. We are a group of smart and dedicated people, and we trust each other to truly own our work and push the project forward.
