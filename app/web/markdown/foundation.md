The Couchers.org project is supported by the Couchers.org Foundation. This is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee for charitable purposes based in New South Wales, Australia, formed specifically for the Couchers.org project.

The [constitution](https://couchers.org/foundation/constitution.pdf) includes a not-for-profit clause, meaning that the foundation can't sell its surplus assets to a for-profit company, and cannot itself change into an entity that is not a not-for-profit.
