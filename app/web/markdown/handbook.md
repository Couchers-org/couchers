### What is couch surfing?

Couch surfing is non-transactional hospitality that is focused on meaningful interactions between the guest and the host rather than the accommodations and amenities.

When you are a couch surfer, you are either hosting someone for free, or staying with someone for free, or meeting up with a local to hang out together. Before agreeing to meet, the host and guest communicate plans and availability during the visit so it is clear what to expect. Couch surfing is NOT for flirting, dating, romance, or sex. It is for making new friends from all around the world, sharing experiences and learning from one another.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="guidelines"></a>

### A brief summary of the Community Guidelines

Below is a brief summary of the guidelines (rules) that all users must agree to after signing up for a Couchers account:

1. **Be kind to one another**

Couchers.org is an inclusive community where people of all cultures and backgrounds come together. Treat everyone with mutual respect and dignity.

2. **This is not a dating app**

Couchers.org is NOT for dating, romance, or sex. Harassment or or using the platform for the purpose of flirting, dating, seeking out romantic or sexual partners, or for engaging in sexual activities will result in an immediate ban.

3. **Be safe and sensible**

Read profiles, references, and resources. [Report](#report) any inappropriate content or behavior.

4. **Keep money out of it**

Keep things non-transactional. Don't exchange money while staying or hosting. Couchers.org is about learning, experiences, and getting to know people.

Please note that these rules are in addition to the [Terms of Service](https://couchers.org/terms) that all users must agree to. A violation of the Terms of Service or Community Guidelines may result in a suspension or permanent ban.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="dating"></a>

### Is it okay to look for a date, romance, or sex on Couchers.org?

**NO!** It is forbidden to use Couchers.org for the purpose of flirting, dating, or seeking out romance or sex. Violation of this rule is grounds for an immediate and permanent ban.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="friending"></a>

### Can I add anyone as a friend?

You should only add someone as a friend if you know them in real life -- either from interacting with each other in person or online at a virtual event. Do not add someone as a friend if you have not interacted with them in person or at a virtual event.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="hosting"></a>

### Do I have to host someone? Is it required to be a host sometime?

No. You do not have to host someone, and you do not have to set your hosting status to "can host" or "maybe can host". You are also not required to meet up with anyone. However, it is recommended that you consider opening up your home to hosting or setting your status as willing to meet up as soon as you are comfortable and your life situation allows.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="askmoney"></a>

### Can I ask for money, gifts, donations, services or work when interacting with other people on Couchers.org?

No. Keep things non-transactional. Don't exchange money, goods, work, donations, or services while staying, hosting, or meeting up. Couchers.org is about learning, experiences, and getting to know people.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="eventpayment"></a>

### Can I create an event that requires payment?

It is forbidden to create, host, share, or promote an event that solicits donations, tips, required payments, or is for-profit.

* It is okay to ask for "gas money" or transportation costs if the event involves necessary transportation that is associated with a significant cost. However, neither the Couchers event organizer nor any associates of the organizer may profit from the transportation costs directly or indirectly.
* It is okay to make event attendees aware of a "cover charge" or "entrance fee" associated with a public venue where the event is held. However, neither the Couchers event organizer nor any associates of the organizer may profit from the cover charge directly or indirectly.
* It is ok to ask attendees to cover their own food and drink costs at an event, as long as neither the Couchers event organizer nor any associates of the organizer may profit from these costs.
* It is okay to ask attendees to bring food or drinks to an event (for example: at a "potluck").

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="spam"></a>

### Is it okay to advertise or promote my business, organization, or cause on Couchers.org?

No. It is a violation of the Terms of Service to use the platform to advertise, promote, or advocate for a business, organization or cause. With that said, it is okay to mention your approval/disapproval of, interest in, or involvement with a business, organization, or cause, as long as that is not the primary purpose of your profile, message, or event.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="report"></a>

### How do I report someone or something that violates the Community Guidelines or Terms of Use (ToU)?

#### Option 1

1. Click on the flag symbol (located below their profile photo or profile circle if they have no photo).
2. Select the reason from the dropdown menu.
3. Fill out the form with further details (OPTIONAL, but very helpful!)
4. Click "Submit".

#### Option 2

Send an email to [safety@couchers.org](mailto:safety@couchers.org). If you send an email, be sure to include the following information:

1. Your username.
2. The username of the person you are reporting (or a link to their profile).
3. Provide as many details about what happened as possible.

**Note:** If you're not sure if something is a violation or not, it is better to just report it. The support team will review the report before any action is taken.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="reachsupport"></a>

### How do I reach support if I have a question?

* Email [support@couchers.org](mailto:support@couchers.org)
* Alternatively, you can visit the forum at [community.couchers.org](https://community.couchers.org) to see if someone has asked that question before and you may find your answer there.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="decide"></a>

### What are some things I should think about before responding to a request?

You should read the person's entire profile and read through their references. References can give you an idea of what others think about the person. It is also very important to communicate thoroughly with the person before accepting their request. Be sure to ask for any information that is missing from their profile or request message. For example, if their profile is empty or missing a photo, it is okay to ask them to fill out their profile and/or upload a photo before accepting their request.

It is also good to ask the person when they will arrive and when they will leave, why they are coming, and who is coming with them. It is helpful to let them know what your schedule looks like and how available you will be to interact with them. Don't feel obligated to provide a bunch of details or private information, but you should let your guest(s) know about any important information about you, your home, and your schedule that is relevant to their visit.

Keep communication on the Couchers.org platform as much as possible. Use common sense when reviewing requests and profiles and especially when providing personal information like your address and schedule. Keep in mind that you are never obligated to accept a request or provide a reason for why you cannot accept. If you decline a request, the person will not be able to message you again unless you add them as a friend. If you accept a request but change your mind, you can reject a request up until the start date of the request by clicking the "reject" button at the bottom of the request.

<a class="handbook-anchor" name="responserate"></a>

### How are "response rate" and "response time" calculated on my profile?

The purpose of the response rate and response time on your profile is to give people an idea on how likely it is that they will receive a response to their hosting request and how long it might take to receive a response. It also influences where you appear in search results. If you respond very quickly to hosting requests you will appear higher than someone who replies after many days. Try to respond to hosting requests as soon as possible, but definitely within two days!

**Response rate** is the proportion of requests that received a response. A “response” is when you click the accept or reject button, or send a message in response to a hosting request. The categories are:

* Not sure yet (Insufficient data): < 3 responses
* Low: response rate <= 33%
* Sometimes: response rate <= 66%
* Usually: response rate <= 90%
* Almost always: response rate > 90%

**Response time** is the duration between when the hosting request was sent and the first response by the host. If the host didn’t respond yet or at all, then response time counts as “infinite”.  "Response time" is based on the 33rd and 66th percentiles of your first responses to requests. So if a third of your fastest responses were in less than 1 hour, and the third of your slowest responses were more than 20 hours, then your response time will be reported as “1 hour to 20 hours”.
