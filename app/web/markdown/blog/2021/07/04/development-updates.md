We publish regular development updates to let you know what we have been working on, as well as what's coming soon.

## Roadmap

A quick overview of what the development team will be working on in the next few weeks.

### Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We've started our mobile development team, but are still looking for contributors to join and help on development of the app, if you're interested, please fill in the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute).

We aim to get Beta quality apps out by the end of this year.

### Events and community features

We're working on releasing events, which we'll roll out gradually in the coming updates.

We've also begun creating initial communities, and are looking for community leaders to help out getting their own local community up and running. If you're interested in this, please sign up to [contribute](https://app.couchers.org/contribute).

## Stats

Since the last update two weeks ago, we had 11 developers contribute to Couchers.org in 301 changes that changed 4.8 thousand lines of code. We welcome the three new contributors who joined in the project and helped out on the codebase.

None of this would be possible without our 100+ volunteers working in all areas of the project. The development teams would like to thank the rest of the core contributors for making our work possible.

## Join the development team

If you're a developer, please join our team on GitHub at [Couchers-org/couchers](https://github.com/couchers-org/couchers) or just give us a star if you appreciate our work! All our code is open source and we need all the help we can get in building the new Couchsurfingâ„¢ alternative.
