### **[Editing references](https://community.couchers.org/t/allow-references-to-be-edited/1495)**


#### **What is being discussed:**



* Should users be able to edit references after posting?


#### **Ideas:**



* Having a reference thread which retains the history of the interaction, a reply-like feature similar to Twitter. Should this be limited to just one reply?
* The safety team (or local community builders) could study the case and decide if a reference thread is to be closed or continued.
* Only allowing edits for typos or minor adjustments, which can be necessary if the reference was written in haste.
* Only editing if you have the recipient’s consent. For example, editing the reference and then requesting the recipient to read and approve it before being published.
* Not allowing edits prevents the ‘revenge reference’, which is quite exhausting to read and usually doesn’t provide much more clarity on the situation from other users’ perspective.

### **[Flexibility on who can leave references](https://community.couchers.org/t/flexibility-for-leaving-references/1539)**


#### **What is being discussed:**



* How to leave a reference for someone you hosted/surfed, but it was not officially requested.
* Is restricting references to only friends/hosts/surfers a good thing?


#### **Ideas:**



* Currently the only option for leaving a reference for someone you didn’t ‘officially’ host is to add them and have the reference come up as by a ‘friend’. You could tell your surfer to send a ‘fake request’ which gets around this problem.
* Have an option available between friends that asks if you’ve ever hosted them before and then gives you a date range in the past to choose between. 
* Explicitly stating on the notifications page that when you become friends with someone, you are consenting to them potentially writing you a reference.
* Limiting references in this way could be restricting, as often people with housemates host and they might all have separate Couchers.org accounts and want to be able to leave a reference even though they were not technically the host.

### **[What’s our ‘verb’?](https://community.couchers.org/t/we-are-couchers-but-are-we-couching/1516)**


#### **What is being discussed:**



* With Couchers.org becoming more popular everyday, thinking about our identity, especially in regards to its position regarding CS, is a hot topic on the forum recently.
* CS has the verb ‘couchsurfing’ inbuilt into the name, so how do we describe what we are doing to people who aren’t doing it yet? How can we make it clear and memorable?


#### **Ideas/comments:**



* Surfing, couchering, crashing, cramping, gandering, sofing...sofa, so good!
* ‘Couching’ is a medical procedure as well as an embroidery technique...who knew?
* Should we just stick to saying to people “we're creating a new couch surfing app and it’s meant to replace couchsurfing.com completely”..?
* ...or are we past the point of having to continue denouncing CS as the basis of our ‘brand’?
