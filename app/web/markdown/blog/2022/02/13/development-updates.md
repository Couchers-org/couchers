We publish regular development updates to let you know what we have been working on, as well as what's coming soon.

## Roadmap

A quick overview of what the development team will be working on in the next few weeks.

### Improvements to dashboard and map search

We are working on a number of ways of streamlining the user experience when searching for a host to make it easier and more likely that you find a host. This includes redoing the ordering algorithm, redesigning the dashboard, and redoing the map page.

### Translations

We continue translating the platform. If you'd like to help translate Couchers.org to your language, [please fill in the translation form](https://couchers.org/translation-form)!
