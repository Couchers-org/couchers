We have the following guides and legal documents:

* [Volunteer Guide](/volunteer-documents/guide): please read this guide for new contributors
* [Code of Conduct](/volunteer-documents/code-of-conduct): the document that outlines volunteer rights and commitments in volunteering
* [Governance and Leadership](/volunteer-documents/governance): an outline for the structure of the Team
* [Data Policy](/volunteer-documents/data-policy): the policy that contributors with access to user data and other confidential information must adhere to when accessing and using such data
* [New Developer Guide](/volunteer-documents/new-developer): guide for new developers on getting started and joining the team
* [Community Builder Guide](/volunteer-documents/community-builder): The guide for new Community Builders including tasks for getting started
