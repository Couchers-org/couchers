If you are part of any groups or discussions (e.g. Facebook or WhatsApp groups), please post there. Even better, try to talk to moderators and convert existing groups to include Couchers.org, like they did in the [Chicago community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cschicago/).\n\n**Talk about us at events**: If you head to any events listed on other couch surfing platforms, mention us to people there!\n\n**YouTubers, Bloggers, Influencers and Media**: If you know any people out there making videos, blogs, or posts about couch surfing or travel in general, talk to them and see if they would like to make any content about the platform.
