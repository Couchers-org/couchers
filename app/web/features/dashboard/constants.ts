### Improvements to dashboard and map search

We are working on a number of ways of streamlining the user experience when searching for a host to make it easier and more likely that you find a host. This includes redoing the ordering algorithm, redesigning the dashboard, and redoing the map page.

### Translations

We continue translating the platform. If you'd like to help translate Couchers.org to your language, [please fill in the translation form](https://couchers.org/translation-form)!

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

You can read the full update by Aapeli on our [blog](https://couchers.org/blog/2022/02/13/development-updates/). You can also join us on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/) to discuss the app development further!`;
