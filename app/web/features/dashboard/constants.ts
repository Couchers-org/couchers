### Translations

We've started up the translation effort, and are working on translating the whole platform into 10 languages! If you'd like to help translate Couchers.org to your language, [please fill in the translation form](https://couchers.org/translation-form)!

### Improved notifications

We're working on improved notifications so you will get notified if something happens in your community or an event. We will also implement granular notification settings to allow you to turn on or off notifications for each topic.

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

You can read the full update by Aapeli on our [blog](https://couchers.org/blog/2021/12/31/development-updates/). You can also join us on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/) to discuss the app development further!`;

**Tell your friends**: If anyone you know would be excited about this new platform, please tell them! If they're active couch surfers and you trust them, we want them here!

**Social media**: Spread the word on your social media platforms. If you are part of any groups or discussions (e.g. Facebook or WhatsApp groups), please post there. Even better, try to talk to moderators and convert existing groups to include Couchers.org, like they did in the [Chicago community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cschicago/).

**Talk about us at events**: If you head to any events listed on other couch surfing platforms, mention us to people there!

**YouTubers, Bloggers, Influencers and Media**: If you know any people out there making videos, blogs, or posts about couch surfing or travel in general, talk to them and see if they would like to make any content about the platform. Get in contact with local news outlets or magazines and see if they would be interested in hearing about Couchers.org.`;
