You can voice your thoughts, opinions, concerns & compliments, and any other feedback you have.

The Open Town Hall will be an opportunity for you to meet the Core Team and ask us any questions about the project, our direction, our roadmap, the state of development, what we're working on, and what we're currently prioritizing. The event will be open to everyone, and will run every fourth Sunday of the month from 14:00 UTC to 15:00 UTC.

The meeting will start with a brief update on progress in the last month, and will then continue in a Question & Answer style where members of the community will have a chance to ask questions and we will do our best to answer them. Brief minutes will be posted on our blog after each meeting.

The events are held on Zoom at this link: [https://couchers.org/town-hall](https://couchers.org/town-hall).

More information can be found on the [forum post](https://community.couchers.org/t/open-town-hall/1291).`;

## Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We've started building mobile apps for Couchers.org, and will be giving updates on the progress in the coming months. If you're a developer with experience using React Native and are interested in contributing to this effort, please complete the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute) and let us know!

## Events and community builders

We've been working hard to build the events feature for you and your community, as well as other functionality for Community Builders to help build their local community. If you'd like to help out in building the couch surfing community near you through Couchers.org, please let us know by filling in the [Community Builder form](https://couchers.org/community-builder-form)!

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

# Bugs

Bugs are to be expected, as we are still in a phase of rapid development. We appreciate you being here to help with that. If you notice any bugs, please report them with the red button in the top right corner.

Please discuss anything else about the app on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/).`;

**Tell your friends**: If anyone you know would be excited about this new platform, please tell them! If they're active couch surfers and you trust them, we want them here!

**Social media**: Spread the word on your social media platforms. If you are part of any groups or discussions (e.g. Facebook or WhatsApp groups), please post there. Even better, try to talk to moderators and convert existing groups to include Couchers.org, like they did in the [Chicago community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cschicago/).

**Talk about us at events**: If you head to any events listed on other couch surfing platforms, mention us to people there!

**YouTubers, Bloggers, Influencers and Media**: If you know any people out there making videos, blogs, or posts about couch surfing or travel in general, talk to them and see if they would like to make any content about the platform. Get in contact with local news outlets or magazines and see if they would be interested in hearing about Couchers.org.`;
